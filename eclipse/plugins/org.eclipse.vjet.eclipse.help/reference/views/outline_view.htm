    <h1>Outline View</h1>
    <p>The
    <b>Outline View</b> displays a structured VJET file that is currently open in the editor area and lists structural elements.</p>
    <br>In the example below, which is for a VJET source file, the structural elements are: method, varialbes and class. </br>
    <p><img src="../images/outline_view.gif" alt="Outline View"></p>
    <p>Besides <b>VJET type(ctype,itype,etype,mtype,otype)</b>, you can also check other types such as <b>native type</b> or <b>nested type</b> in outline view.
        
    <p>The <b>Outline View Context Menu</b> is introduced below.</p>
	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width=100%>
      <caption>Context Menu</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td>Open Type Hierarchy</td>
