    <h1>VJET Builder</h1>
    <p>
      The VJET builder also known as <b>Script builder</b> builds VJET programs using a compiler that implements the VJET Language Specification.
      The VJET builder can build programs incrementally.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can reach the <b>Builder Page</b> through the Project window (Project &gt; Builders) from the context menu on a created project
      or the <a href="./menus/menu_file.htm">File menu</a> of the workbench.
