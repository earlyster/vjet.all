    <h1>VJET Build Path page</h1>
    <p>The options in this page indicate the build path settings for a VJET project.</p>
    <p>
      You can reach this page through the Project window (<b>Project &gt; Properties &gt; VJET &gt; VJET build path</b>) from the context menu on a created project
      or the <a href="../menus/menu_file.htm">File menu</a> of the workbench.
    </p>

    <p>The build class path is a list of paths visible to the compiler when building the project.</p>
    
    <h2>Source tab</h2>
    <p>
      Source folders are top-level folders in the project hierarchy. They are the root of packages containing .js files.
    </p>

	<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" summary="Source folder options" width=100%>
	  <caption>Source folder options</caption>
	  <tbody>
		<tr>
		  <th>Option</th>
		  <th>Description</th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td align="left" valign="top" width="20%">Add Folder</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top">Creates a new folder to contain source</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td align="left" valign="top">Edit</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top">
			  Allows to modify the currently selected source folder or source folder attribute.
			</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Remove</td>
			<td>
			  Removes the selected folders from the class path. This does not delete the folders nor their contents.
			</td>
		</tr>
	  </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Projects tab</h2>
    <p>In the <b>Required projects on the build path</b> list, you can add project dependencies by selecting other workbench
    projects to add to the build path for this new project.</p>

    <p>Adding a required project indirectly adds all its classpath entries marked as 'exported'. Setting a classpath entry as exported is done in the Order and Export tab.</p>

    <p>The projects selected here are automatically added to the referenced projects list. The referenced project list is used to determine the build order. A project is always
    build after all its referenced projects are built.</p>
    
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding= "5" summary="Source folder options" width=100%>
	  <tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Action</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center" valign="middle" width="20%">Add</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top">Add another project in the workspace to the build path of this project.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center" valign="middle" width="20%">Edit</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top">Edit the classpath attribute of a required project.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td align="center" valign="middle" width="20%">Remove</td>
			<td align="left" valign="top">Removes the selected required projects from the list.</td>
		</tr>
	  </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Libraries tab</h2>
    <p>On this page, you can add libraries to the build path.</p>
    <p>By default, the library list contains an entry representing the VJET runtime library.

    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding= "5" summary="libraries tab options" width=100%>
      <caption> Libraries tab options</caption>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th width="20%">Option</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td align="left" valign="top">Add ZIPS..</td>
          <td align="left" valign="top">Allows you to navigate the workbench hierarchy and select ZIP files to add to the build path.</td>
        </tr>

          <td>
            Allows to add a predefined libraries. 
            Such libraries can stand for an arbitrary number of entries (visible as children node of the library node)</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td align="left" valign="top">Remove</td>
          <td align="left" valign="top">
            Removes the selected element from the build path. This does not delete the resource.
          </td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
          <td align="left" valign="top">Migrate ZIP File...</td>
          <td align="left" valign="top">
            Migrate a zip on the build path to a newer version. 
            If the newer version contains refactoring scripts the refactoring stored in the script will be executed.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
	
    <h2>Order and Export tab</h2>
    <p>
      In the <b>Build class path order</b> list, you can click the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons to move the selected path entry up or down in the build path order for this new project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Checked list entries are marked as exported. Exported entries are visible to projects that require the project. Use the <b>Select
      All</b> and <b>Deselect All</b> to change the checked state of all entries. Source folders are always exported,
      and can not be deselected.
    </p>
