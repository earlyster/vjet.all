    <h1>VJET glossary</h1>
    <p><b>compilation unit</b></p>
    <p>
      A VJET source file.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>field</b></p>
    <p>
      A field inside a type.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>VJET elements</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      VJET elements are VJET projects, packages, types, members, methods and fields.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <p><b>VJET types</b></p>
    <p>
      VJET Types represent structured types, which can be defined for JavaScript and are similar to those found in other languages.
      <br>Including: ctype, itype, etype, mtype, otype.
    </p>  
    
    <p><b>ctype</b></p>
    <p>
      Class - Encapsulates state and behavior, provides a defined construction mechanism to create instances
    </p>
    
    <p><b>itype</b></p>
    <p>
	  Interface - Analogous to a Java Interface; definitional only, does not contain implementation
    </p>
    
    <p><b>etype</b></p>
    <p>
	  Enum - Represents an enumeration and can be used to declare constants
    </p>
    
    <p><b>mtype</b></p>
    <p>
	  Mixin - Analogous to the Mixin type used by other languages (eg. Perl, Python), can be definitional and include implementation. 
	  Can be used to simulate multiple inheritance behavior 
    </p>
    
    <p><b>etype</b></p>
    <p>
	  Enum - Represents an enumeration and can be used to declare constants
    </p>
        
    <p><b>otype</b></p>
    <p>
	  Object Literal - Provides a type namespace for object literal and function definitions;
	  definitional only and does not include implementation
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <p><b>VJET projects</b></p>
    <p>
      Projects which contain compilable VJET source code and are the containers for source folders or packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>method</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A method or constructor inside a type.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>packages</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of types that contain Java compilation units and CLASS files.

      <strong>type</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A type inside a compilation unit or ser file.
