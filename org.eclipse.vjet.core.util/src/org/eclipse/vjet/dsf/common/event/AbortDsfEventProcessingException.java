/**
 * This exception can be thrown during DsfEvent processing to terminate the
 * currently executing DNode.  DsfEvent's actually do the 
 * dispatching to the registered Listeners.  The currently executing Listener
 * that throws this will immediately stop the current Listeners processing and
 * stop any other Listener processing for this event.
 * 
 * The use of an exception for control flow is against the general V4 Error
 * guidelines.  However, there are rare cases where there is no better approach
 * for the framework to obtain similar functionality without complicating the
 * event programming model so an exception (no pun intended) was made.
