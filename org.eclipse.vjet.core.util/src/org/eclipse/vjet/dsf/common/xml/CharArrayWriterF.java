/**
 * This class takes an input char[] buffer so that it can be used as a Writer.  
 * 
 * The data can be retrieved "copied" using toCharArray() and toString().
 * 
 * getBackingChars() will return the passed in or set char[] UNLESS the current in
 * char[] size was exceeded and then a new char[] buffer is created.
 * 
 * setBackingChars(char[]) can be called at anytime.  It is up to the client to
 * understand that replacing the backing char[] simply means to continue processing
 * but use the newly passed in char[].
 *
 * This implementation is NOT threadsafe and was designed for maximum speed
 * and the reuse of externally provided char[]'s.  Superclass methods:
 * write(char[], int, int), write(int), write(String, int, int) were specifically
 * overriden to NOT use a lock.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Note: Invoking close() on this class has no effect, and methods
 * of this class can be called after the stream has closed
 * without generating an IOException.
