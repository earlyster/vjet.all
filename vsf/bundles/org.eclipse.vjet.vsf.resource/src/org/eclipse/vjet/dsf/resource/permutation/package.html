Permutation is a generalization of the Java concept of Locale. 
A Permutation can be affected by three factors:
<ul>
	<li>Language - the language in which content is expressed (for example, German)</li>
	<li>Target - A specific site, location or region (for example, EBAY_DE, EBAY_AUTOS)</li>
	<li>Variation - business requirements, features, ... that can change displayed content</li>
</ul>
<p>
Permutation is largely used with the V4 Content system for transparently delivering
translated content to all of the countries. However, it is also used in other parts
of the system where different countries may want a different resource. Some examples
include: images and links.
