/**
 * EntityReference nodes may be used to represent an entity reference in the tree. 
 * Note that character references and references to predefined entities are considered to 
 * be expanded by the HTML or XML processor so that characters are represented by 
 * their Unicode equivalent rather than by an entity reference. 
 * Moreover, the XML processor may completely expand references to entities while building the Document, 
 * instead of providing EntityReference nodes. 
 * If it does provide such nodes, then for an EntityReference node that represents a reference 
 * to a known entity an Entity exists, and the subtree of the EntityReference node is 
 * a copy of the Entity node subtree. However, the latter may not be true when an entity contains 
 * an unbound namespace prefix. In such a case, because the namespace prefix resolution 
 * depends on where the entity reference is, the descendants of the EntityReference node may be 
 * bound to different namespace URIs. 
 * When an EntityReference node represents a reference to an unknown entity, 
 * the node has no children and its replacement value, when used by Attr.value for example, is empty.
