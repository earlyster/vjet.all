 * CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters 
 * that would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is recognized 
 * in a CDATA section is the "]]>" string that ends the CDATA section. 
 * CDATA sections cannot be nested. Their primary purpose is for including material 
 * such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all the delimiters.
