This package is used for expression the various schemas for the various
HTML standards.  XHTML could be expressed with XML schema; however,
like previous versions of the HTML standards, an SGML DTD is used.  These
classes are a representation of the information.  Initially, they will only
contain tag name, attribute names, whether or not the attribute is required
and/or has a default value and whether or not an end tag should be emitted.
