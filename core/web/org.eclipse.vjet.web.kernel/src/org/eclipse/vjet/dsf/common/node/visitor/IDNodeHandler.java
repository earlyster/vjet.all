 * ComponentHandlers work with DsfComponents.  During a Visitor pattern traversal
 * of a DsfComponent graph, an accepted visitor will have the methods contained
 * in this interface called in this order:
 * <li> preProcess(...)
 * <li> process(...)
 * <li> postProcess(...)
 * 
 * The benefit of this multiple method handler becomes apparent when it is needed
 * for simple things like emitting output to a target such as XML.  You really want
 * to have the ability to start a tag, do what you need with your children and
 * then close the tag.
