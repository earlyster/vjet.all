/*
Entity Declarations

Entities must be declared before they can be used. They may be declared in the DTD, 
if your XML parser processes the DTD (also known as the external subset), or the 
internal subset. Note: if the same entity is declared more than once, only the 
first declaration applies and the internal subset is processed before the external 
subset.
<p>
All entities are declared with the "ENTITY" declaration. The exact format of the 
declaration distinguishes between internal, external, and parameter entities.
<p>
Declaring Internal Entities
<p>
An internal entity declaration has the following form:

<!ENTITY entityname "replacement text">

You can use either double or single quotes to delimit the replacement text. The 
declaration of yoyo, mentioned earlier, would be:

<!ENTITY yoyo 'Yoyodyne Industries, Inc.'>

Declaring External Entities

External entity declarations come in two forms. If the external entity contains 
XML text, the declaration has the following form:

<!ENTITY entityname [PUBLIC "public-identifier"]
	SYSTEM "system-identifier">

The system identifier must point to an instance of a resource via a URI, most 
commonly a simple filename. The public identifier, if supplied, may be used by 
an XML system to generate an alternate URI (this provides a handy level of 
indirection on systems that support public identifiers).

An external entity that incorporates chap1.xml into your document might be 
declared like this:

<!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM "chap1.xml">

Despite the growing trend to store everything in XML, there are some legacy 
systems that still store data in non-XML formats. Graphics are sometimes stored 
in odd formats like PNG and GIF, for example ;-).

External entities that refer to these files must declare that data they contain 
is not XML. They accomplish this by indicating the format of the external entity 
in a notation:

<!ENTITY entityname [PUBLIC "public-identifier"]
	SYSTEM "system-identifier" notation>

See the section called Entity Attributes for more detail. An external entity 
that refers to the GIF image pic01.gif might be declared like this:

<!ENTITY mypicture SYSTEM "pic01.gif" GIF>

Declaring Parameter Entities

Parameter entity declarations are identified by a % preceding the entity name:

<!ENTITY % pentityname1 "replacement text">
<!ENTITY % pentityname2 SYSTEM "URI">

Note the space following the % in the declaration. Parameter entities can be 
either internal or external, but they cannot refer to non-XML data (you can't 
have a parameter entity with a notation).
Entity Attributes

External entities can be further classified as either "parsed" or "unparsed". 
Entities which refer to external files that contain XML are called 
"parsed entities;" entities which refer to other types of data, identified by a 
notation, are "unparsed."

The parser inserts the replacement text of a parsed entity into the document 
wherever a reference to that entity occurs. It is an error to insert an entity 
reference to an unparsed entity directly into the flow of an XML document. 
Unparsed entities can only be used as attribute values on elements with ENTITY 
attributes.

Unparsed entities are used most frequently on XML elements that incorporate 
graphics into a document. Consider the following brief document:

<!DOCTYPE doc [
<!ELEMENT doc (para|graphic)+>
<!ELEMENT para (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT graphic EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST graphic
        image ENTITY #REQUIRED
        alt   CDATA  #IMPLIED
>

<!NOTATION GIF SYSTEM "CompuServe Graphics Interchange Format 87a">
<!ENTITY mypicture SYSTEM "normphoto.gif" GIF>
<!ENTITY norm "Norman Walsh">
]>
<doc>
<para>The following element incorporates the image declared as
	"mypicture":</para>
<graphic image="mypicture" alt="A picture of &norm"/>
</doc>

You could also declare the image attribute as CDATA and simply type the filename, 
but the use of an entity offers a useful level of indirection.
Entities in Attribute Values

There is a somewhat subtle distinction between entity attributes and entity 
references in attribute values. An "ordinary" (CDATA) attribute contains text. 
You can put internal entity references in that text, just as you can in any other 
content. An ENTITY attribute can only contain the name of an external, unparsed 
entity. In particular, note that it contains the name of the entity, not a 
reference to the entity.
Entity Expansion

Section 4.4 and Appendix D of the XML Recommendation describe all the details of 
entity expansion. The key points are:

    * Character references are expanded immediately. They behave exactly as if 
      you had typed the literal character.
    * Entity references in the replacement text of other entities are not expanded 
      until the entity being declared is referenced. In other words, this is legal 
      in the internal subset:

      <!ENTITY foobar "&f;bar">
      <!ENTITY f      "foo">

      because the entity reference "&f;" isn't expanded until "&foobar;" is expanded.
      
    * Parsed entities are recognized in the body of your document, where unparsed 
      entities are forbidden. Unparsed entities are allowed in entity attributes, 
      where parsed entities are forbidden.
      
    * Although you can put references to internal entities in attribute values, 
      it is illegal to refer to an external entity in an attribute value.
