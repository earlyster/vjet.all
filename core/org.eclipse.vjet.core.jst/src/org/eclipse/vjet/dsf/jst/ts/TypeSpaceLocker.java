/**
 * Locker to synchronize data lookup and update operations.
 * Internally it has two collaborating lockers:
 * <li>Shared Lock: blocks if and only if there is update operation going on</li>
 * <li>Exclusive Lock: blocks if and only if there is any lookup or update operation going on.</li>
 * 
 * Please note: 
 * <li>Any Lock operation much be put inside a try block, and paired 
 * with a corresponding Release operation in the finally block</li>
 * <li>Any lookup operation must use lockShared() and releaseShared()</li>
 * <li>Any update operation must use lockExclusive() and releaseExclusive()</li>
 * <li>update operations, if blocked, will be queued and unblocked 
 * in the same order as lockExclusive() is invoked.</li>
 * <li>Update operation can have nested lookup operations. 
 * However, nested update operation inside lookup operation is not supported</li>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Delegate to Java 5 ReadWriteLock implementation 1/23/09 by Yubin
