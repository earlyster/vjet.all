	/**
	 * The pushState() method
	 * 
	 * pushState() takes three parameters: a state object, a title (which is
	 * currently ignored), and (optionally) a URL. Let's examine each of these
	 * three parameters in more detail:
	 * 
	 * @param state
	 *            object Ñ The state object is a JavaScript object which is
	 *            associated with the new history entry created by pushState().
	 *            Whenever the user navigates to the new state, a popstate event
	 *            is fired, and the state property of the event contains a copy
	 *            of the history entry's state object.
	 * 
	 *            The state object can be anything that you can pass to
	 *            JSON.stringify. Because Firefox saves state objects to the
	 *            user's disk so they can be restored after the user restarts
	 *            her browser, we impose a size limit of 640k characters on the
	 *            JSON representation of a state object. If you pass a state
	 *            object whose JSON representation is larger than this to
	 *            pushState(), the method will throw an exception. If you need
	 *            more space than this, you're encouraged to use sessionStorage
	 *            and/or localStorage.
	 * @param title
	 *            Ñ Firefox currently ignores this parameter, although it may
	 *            use it in the future. Passing the empty string here should be
	 *            safe against future changes to the method. Alternatively, you
	 *            could pass a short title for the state to which you're moving.
	 * @param URL
	 *            Ñ The new history entry's URL is given by this parameter. Note
	 *            that the browser won't attempt to load this URL after a call
	 *            to pushState(), but it might attempt to load the URL later,
	 *            for instance after the user restarts her browser. The new URL
	 *            does not need to be absolute; if it's relative, it's resolved
	 *            relative to the current URL. The new URL must be of the same
	 *            origin as the current URL; otherwise, pushState() will throw
	 *            an exception. This parameter is optional; if it isn't
	 *            specified, it's set to the document's current URL.
	 * 
	 *            In a sense, calling pushState() is similar to setting
	 *            window.location = "#foo", in that both will also create and
	 *            activate another history entry associated with the current
	 *            document. But pushState() has a few advantages:
	 * 
	 *            The new URL can be any URL in the same origin as the current
	 *            URL. In contrast, setting window.location keeps you at the
	 *            same document only if you modify only the hash. You don't have
	 *            to change the URL if you don't want to. In contrast, setting
	 *            window.location = "#foo"; only creates a new history entry if
	 *            the current hash isn't #foo. You can associate arbitrary data
	 *            with your new history entry. With the hash-based approach, you
	 *            need to encode all of the relevant data into a short string.
	 * 
	 *            Note that pushState() never causes a hashchange event to be
	 *            fired, even if the new URL differs from the old URL only in
	 *            its hash.
