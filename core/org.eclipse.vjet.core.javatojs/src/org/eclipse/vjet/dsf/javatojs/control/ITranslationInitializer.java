 * Contract for Java to JS translation initializers.
 * <p>
 * There can be one top-level initializer for each translation process.
 * The top-level initializer can specify other initializers that it
 * depends on</p>
 * <p>
 * When initialization starts, translation controller will first collect
 * all initializers based on dependency chain starting from top-level
 * initializer. Then all initializers will be invoked one by one based on 
 * their locations in the dependency chains. Please note:
 * <li>Same type of initializers will be dedupped.</li>
 * <li>The deeper is it in the chains, the earlier will it be executed.</li>
 * <li>Exception should be thrown if any cyclic dependency is detected.</li>
